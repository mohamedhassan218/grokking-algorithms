# Gorkking Algorithms

This repository contains Python and C++ code implementations for the algorithms discussed in the book ["Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms).

## Overview

Each chapter of the book corresponds to a Python file in this repository. The naming convention follows the pattern `chapter X.py`, where `X` represents the chapter number.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system. The code is written in Python 3.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:mohamedhassan218/grokking-algorithms.git
    ```

### In Python:

1. Navigate to the Python directory:
    ```
    cd "Grokking Algorithms in Python"
    ```

2. Run the Python files corresponding to the chapters you're interested in:
    ```
    python chapter1.py
    ```

### In C++:

1. Navigate to the C++ directory:
    ```
    cd "Grokking Algorithms in C++"
    ```

2. Compile and run the C++ files corresponding to the chapters you're interested in. For example:
    ```
    g++ chapter1.cpp -o chapter1
    ./chapter1
    ```

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any bugs or want to improve the existing code, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Aditya Bhargava for writing **Grokking Algorithms** and making the concepts accessible through practical examples. I really benefited a lot from this book and it was a good start for me towards the basic computer science principles.
